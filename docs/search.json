The top half of the image is the back side of the\n            postcard, which includes a legend about how to interpret the\n            graph. Each element in the legend corresponds to a weather\n            component, mood, or productivity. Each circle in the graph\n            represents one day of observation. Scroll down to learn\n            more!\n            \n            Insights: What insights did you concretely\n            identify with your visualization?\n            I made an effort to include lots of information so there\n            were lots of insights to identify. It is evident that I had\n            a neutral mood throughout most of the observation week. This\n            week I also had particularly low productivity. Wind speed\n            was mostly moderate throughout the week, as was UV index. I\n            was surprised to see that good moods were correlated with\n            relatively cooler weather. Good moods were more common in\n            the evenings, and high productivity was more common in the\n            mornings. Overall there is not a strong, identifiable\n            association between UV index, humidity, and mood or\n            productivity. Based on this data, I can’t definitively say\n            how my mood and productivity changes with the weather.\n            ii. Reflection Pt I: Lupi and Posavec said that\n            Dear Data helped them “live a quantified life, and become\n            more attuned to their surroundings.” What did you learn\n            about yourself through this process? How did you think about\n            data collection and data visualization? What is your\n            approach to data collection and to data visualization? How\n            easy or difficult was it for you to identify patterns and\n            insights in your data?\n            This process made me think more explicitly about my daily\n            mood and productivity. I also found myself being more\n            attentive to details/nuances of the weather, beyond\n            temperature. The data collection process was fairly\n            straightforward; I set reminders on my phone to make note of\n            my mood and productivity twice a day. At the end of the day\n            I gathered the weather statistics from my phone as well.\n            This was an efficient system, as it was easy to collect the\n            data. I found the visualization portion quite challenging\n            though. I ended up choosing a circular icon to represent\n            each day, inspired by Posavec’s Week of Privacy postcard. I\n            felt each icon was similar to a clock face which visually\n            relates to the comparisons between mornings and evenings. I\n            then considered elements to put on top of the circle, such\n            as an arrow indicating the direction and speed of wind that\n            day. Humidity was also easy to include using the outline of\n            the circle, given that humidity is typically reported as a\n            percentage. I added UV index through “rays” that indicate\n            0.5 units each, which felt thematically appropriate. I\n            struggled to find a way to include daily average\n            temperature, but ended up going with ticks showing how many\n            degrees (Fahrenheit) above 45 the temperature was that day.\n            At this point I liked how much each icon looked like a\n            clockface, and also felt I had maxed out on variables. I\n            ended up being able to include 7 variables in my postcard\n            (mood, productivity, wind speed, wind direction, average\n            daily temperature, UV index, and humidity). I think this\n            format made it easiest to identify patterns and insights in\n            mood, productivity, humidity, wind speed, and wind\n            direction. UV index and daily average temperature were less\n            prominent visually, and also varied much less, making\n            patters harder to identify.\n            iii. Reflection Pt II: What was your favorite\n            part of this project? What did you find most difficult? If\n            you could do it again, what would you do\n            differently?\n            My favourite part of this project was visualizing the\n            data on the postcard. This was also the most challenging,\n            but it made the trial-and-error process very enjoyable. I\n            also enjoy arts and crafts so it was nice to indulge in that\n            sort of thinking for class work (which is rare!). If I could\n            do this project again, I would choose to collect\n            precipitation data as well because I think it could be\n            relevant to mood and productivity. I would also experiment\n            more with visualization shapes; as I finished up the\n            postcard I found myself still thinking about other icons and\n            how effective they might have been, such as a star shape. In\n            general I think it would be fun to collect data over a\n            longer period, and also take more time to figure out the\n            visualization. This would result in a more rich,\n            informative, and visually-engaging postcard.\n          \n          \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n            Dear Data Postcard\n          \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            Inspired by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec’s Dear Data\n            postcard exchange, I spent one week observing how my\n            mood and productivity are related to various elements of\n            weather.

      "contents": "\n\n\nReflection: Briefly, reflect on the major decisions that you made in designing the\nlayout of the app and your logic/rationale for making that decision. Also discuss the alternative ideas and why you decided not to go with those.\nThe first decision made as a group was which dataset to use. Some of the team members had used Cars in the past and found this dataset accessible and with interesting variables. After deciding on the dataset, we decided the target audience would be the general public with limited knowledge of cars. Once we had decided on the dataset and audience, we brainstormed the types of graphs/visualizations we wanted to include and went to the design board. We designed the layout to guide users naturally across the dashboard as they look from left-to-right and row-by-row (i.e. they first see the title at the top, then read left-to-right to make selections, then view the plot, etc.). The requirements of the assignment also drove some decision making for this part (e.g. a scatterplot that depicts bivariate analysis). We considered integrating more complex filters and variables, but decided against them to avoid overwhelming users inexperienced with cars. However, we decided on City MPG vs Highway MPG for the scatterplot as this would be useful to the common person who is making a decision about which car to buy. We also decided to filter the data by price and size of vehicle as those would be the second most important factors for most people when buying a car. We felt having the option to filter the scatterplot by both price and size of vehicle added more insight for the user. Finally, HTML tags were used to adjust the formatting of text to enhance the visual appeal of the dashboard. We originally planned to output an image or rows of the dataset based on the radio button input, but decided against this as it would not be as meaningful to users as an informative blurb about car sizes. We initially wanted a pale blue background for the app as shown in Figure 1, but ended up going with light purple because it looked better to us.\nAnalysis: Briefly, explain the story that your app tells. What lessons or conclusions can you reach for your analysis using the app that you created. Make sure you provide evidence for all conclusions/claims that you make (this might include screenshots of visuals/outputs from the app if necessary).\nThe Cars for Dummies app provides a simple summary of basic car attributes. Specifically, there is information on maximum price, highway MPG, city MPG, and size. The goal of the app is to illustrate how MPG changes with price and size. There is a scatterplot illustrating the relationship between highway MPG and city MPG, which changes with inputs of price and size. In general the scatterplot shows a positive correlation between highway MPG and city MPG. When looking at all size and prices, data points are more populated and close-together in the low MPG area. Overall, the scatterplot shows that higher-priced cars do not necessarily offer better fuel-efficiency, which may be of surprise to first-time car buyers. Many high priced cars have high city MPG, but moderate highway MPG. This filter also shows how few cars fall into the price range, regardless of size. By reading the detailed descriptions of car sizes, users can learn about the typical features and advantages of each size. This will likely inform their car-purchasing decisions. The selection of a car size also modifies the scatterplot. We can compare fuel efficiency by car size; both small and midsize cars have fuel efficiency that is comparable to all sizes–strong positive correlation and a higher concentration of vehicles in the low MPG region. Large vehicles appear to have a much weaker positive correlation between highway MPG and city MPG, and almost all of the large vehicles have very low city MPG.\n\n\n\n",
